# stock-market-prediciton
A personal project I developed to practice skills in machine learning and data analytics by predicting if a stock will increase or decrease the next day.


Medium stock market prediction model example: https://medium.com/@deepml1818/predicting-stock-prices-with-machine-learning-in-python-a-step-by-step-guide-c53f36ab1ccd

Some things to look into in terms of improving model accuracy; improving machine learning skills, knowledge, etc.; and things to talk about if asked what to do to improve this project:

LSTMs & Recurring Neural Networks
TensorFlow & Keras ?
MAPE & RSME for performance testing. Reference hackathon project from the summer as these were metrics you used!!

This is an expansion with TensorFlor & Keras: https://medium.com/@arslankamcybekov7/how-i-built-a-model-that-predicts-stock-prices-57c010b2beb7

Look into more feature engineering to improve accuracy. How can you create more and better features that include the seasonality of the data?
